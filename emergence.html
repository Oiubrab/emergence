			<p style="font-style: italic" class="textblock">Don't cry. Don't ever cry. Tears are the only thing that satisfies them. Tears are why they come this night, and every night since. Why the walls of the house smell of burnt gunpowder and the cold steel of the Samovar now is filled with scant comfort. Tears for an empty house and tears for the memories that haunt. Andrei and Julia and her friends and their lovers and everyone. Everyone. Everyone has...</p>
		
			<p style="font-style: italic" class="textblock">There is no question, there are no questions anymore. There is no point in asking. There's no one here to ask.</p>
		
			<p class="textblock">It was this house; once frothing, seething to the brim with the savage laughter of children and the horror of it’s mundane conversations, now stood quiet and broken, the shattered womb. Those frivolous sounds, that emerge only from innocence, congealed the view that the whole point of their life, the whole point of living, had grown from the irrevocable fact that their lives were settled and there was nothing for it but to get on with it and make what enjoyment and pleasure they could. All of this seemed to Yeno, at once and in unison, a cacophonous scream of silent voices that grew virulently in her mind. Then, at the turn of a thought, were clamped down and held there, still screaming but tolerable for a moment. And with this periodic mind, at one time shattered and another steady, Yeno gripped the railing sitting beside her. She gripped it with all her power. She gripped it like she would not let go and, in that moment, if someone would have come to take her away, they would have had to do so with such a great force as to tear her arms from her.</p>
		
			<p class="textblock">And the great chime could still be heard throughout the hall. Like a hammer, it struck Yeno. The familiar sound of the grand clock, signifying the joy of mealtime, or the madness of playtime or the pleasant thoughts that drew Yeno into the imagination she clung to. She clung to this because, unlike the others or, more accurately, because she had perceived that, unlike the other children in the hatchery, her thoughts and her dreams were really her entire world. That her energy and fire when she questioned the younger Julia on the true nature of her brief but powerful bouts of passion, or playful teasing she impressed upon Andrei, imagining this in conscious thought simple friendly play; that all of these cute dalliances of fancy could be brought back to the interminable striking of this clock. And now, staring wildly at this relic, alone at the end of the hall, she could see and she could hear the echo of a life that seemed to her, like what an old woman must feel revisiting the place of her birth, quite removed from the lingering sense of familiarity but also aware , from a faint memory of joy, that this simple physical place represented a most hopeful place in her life. The knife in Yeno’s mind plunged deeper.</p>
		
			<p class="textblock">The hallway that Yeno stood in was not long, only a couple of metres maybe. To Yeno it was the entire extent of her world at that moment. Her eyes, pulled away from the foreboding grand oak clock, glided over the sickly yellow and green colours that Yeno had always imagined were chosen on purpose to make the inhabitants feel pitiful. Again, tears were welling up, but she did not cry. <i>You cannot cry in this place, Yeno</i>. And she griped the railing tighter, and her hands grew white from the strain. <i>But what does this have to do with me? Why should I be the ruin of all this?</i></p>
		
			<p class="textblock">Yeno released the railing and, all of a sudden, her mental crutch, which had coursed through her deathly grip, subsided along with her fear. Her great back arched erect and she assumed the shape, but not the form, of confidence. Yeno brought her large hands gently to her sides and contorted her graceful features. But ashes continued to fall through the space that once held a roof, shrouding Yeno in a wool of destruction that gently, but utterly, reminded her at once where she was and how much danger she no longer cared about. There was no sense of survival to distract her from the stench that she could just now tell was emanating from her. Coldness, the bitter frigid coldness, it grew into her through her tattered white wraparound dress that had been torn beyond any sort of modesty and yellow in parts she refused to remember. And the bleak, grey sky above closed any sense of hope for her...</p>
		
			<p class="textblock">Ding! The grand clock’s tone struck Yeno again and her sense of composure gave way to a sharp panicked look, an animalistic gesture and she again grasped the railing tightly. But, on seeing that the clock was the source of the sound, her eyes subsided from that most primal fear to the fear her consciousness brought.</p> 
		
			<p style="font-style: italic" class="textblock">It’s all from my hands.</p>
		
			<p class="textblock">That thought, that awful sense Yeno felt somewhere distant, temporarily caused her enough distraction from her arresting fear that she was able to take her first step. Such a simple step. The muffled sound of rubber on cement was heard, by Yeno and by whoever else Yeno might wish to be alive here. The foot pressed through the shoe, into the ground. But, to Yeno, it was as if a new world was being born. At once, knowing what she knew, and looking around at this strange new world, Yeno could only rush to an escape from it.</p>
