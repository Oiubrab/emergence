			<p style="font-style: italic" class="text_story_grey">Don't cry. Don't ever cry. Because there are no tears left. There are no tears left. I have poured them all out.</p>
		
			<p style="font-style: italic" class="text_story_grey">I have all poured out</p>
		
			<p style="font-style: italic" class="text_story_grey">There is no question, there are no questions anymore. There is no point in asking. There's no one here to ask.</p>
		
			<p class="text_story_grey">It was this house; once frothing, seething to the brim with the savage laughter of children and the delightful horror of it’s mundane conversations, that looked inwards. It now stood quiet and broken, a shattered womb. From the fluorescent green cracks in the grey rubble, those frivolous memories, that emerge only from innocence, congealed and settled in places in her mind that were not accessible. Every little jagged edge that folded around Yeno dragged at her. Pain is something remembered, not simply felt. Each wound, wherever it is placed, can rush back at the slightest memory, and every memory be brought flooding back at the slightest whiff of a recognised reflection. As shaken hands came before knees in between blocks of concrete, and Yeno crawled out of her childhood bedroom, the reflection was everywhere and she was within them all.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And the great chime could still be heard throughout the hall. Like a hammer, it struck Yeno. The familiar sound of the grand clock, signifying the joy of mealtime, or the madness of playtime, drew Yeno into the imagination she grasped at. This physical object, sitting at the end of the hall, called for those fine lines of innocence that were figments squashed by the interminable weight of every single moment screaming within her head for an end. And now, staring wildly at this relic, alone at the end of the hall, she could see and she could hear the echo of a life that seemed to her, like what an old woman must feel revisiting the place of her birth, quite removed from the lingering sense of familiarity but also aware , from a faint memory of joy, that this simple physical place represented a most hopeful place in her life. The knife in Yeno’s mind plunged deeper.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">The hallway that Yeno had crawled into was not long, only a couple of metres maybe. To Yeno it was the entire extent of her world at that moment. Her eyes, pulled away from the foreboding grand oak clock, followed the brilliant greens and blues, colours that Yeno had always imagined were chosen on purpose to make the inhabitants feel ill on purpose. Again, tears were welling up, leaking out of her. But she did not cry. And she griped the fallen railing beside her tighter, and her hands grew white from the strain. And every moment was the only moment within her.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And out of an automatic movement, not so much a determination, but an act in deficit of any other destination, Yeno began to crawl towards the clock. Her naked body scraped along the jagged metallic edges of the things that had come from above. The physical pain was only a reflection, something abstract. As the railing beside her rose up to standing level, so did she. Her great back arched erect and she assumed the shape, but not the form, of confidence. Yeno brought her large hands gently to her sides and contorted her graceful features. But ashes continued to fall sporadically through the space that once held a roof, shrouding Yeno in a wool of destruction that gently, but utterly, reminded her at once where she was. There was no sense of survival to distract her from the stench that she could just now tell was emanating from her. Coldness, the bitter frigid coldness, it grew into her through her tattered white wraparound dress that had been torn beyond any sort of modesty and yellow in parts she refused to remember. And the bleak, grey sky above closed any sense of hope for her…</p>
		
			<p style="font-style: italic" class="text_story_grey">It’s all from my hands.</p>
		
			<p class="text_story_grey">That thought, that awful sense Yeno felt somewhere distant, temporarily caused her enough distraction from her arresting fear that she was able to take her first step. Such a simple step. The muffled sound of rubber on cement was heard, by Yeno and by whoever else Yeno might wish to be alive here.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">The steps began to creak forth timidly. Yeno’s hand inched along the railing, her fingers walking along the scoured bar holds that offered her less and less buoyancy as she moved forward. Yeno looked along the walls for genuine signs of the past. The brilliant green that had covered the walls throughout the hallways sat covered behind the twisted pipes that had come down with the toilets above. Foundations could be seen through much of what the hallway had been. The paintings were gone, replaced by wires and bent copper. But the old Grandfather clock still stood there at the end of the hall, and the longer Yeno stared at the great oak symbol of certainty, it grew more and more out of place among the ruins. It was as if it had been left there for some reason, and Yeno started to sense something sinister behind that grand oak clock. It was that invisible hand, something terrible in its final embrace that reached out and put it’s hands around Yeno. Her hand left the railing entirely, the need for stability forgotten. She quietly moved towards that grand oak clock. The shrouded heart within her was felt to crack with each increasingly desperate step. And when she reached that lumbering gaudy monstrosity she sat down gently, rested her hand on the strong oak, and it’s hand wrapped itself around Yeno’s searching heart.</p>

			<p style="font-style: italic" class="text_story_grey">I, it’s all gone. I’m all gone. The clock is here and here I am and there’s nothing, I’m nothing. I’m just a dream of this place, a memory, and I’m as faded as the walls and the floor and the toys. They left noting but this clock, this thing that should hold so much joy for me. And I know, I remember all the games and the secret handshake and the sweet lips. But now it means nothing, and I can’t find those moments in my heart, only in my head. I should just lay here and die, among the rubble and the rust and the ashen death. I want to cry. I wanted to cry. There’s nothing, I’m nothing. They…   I loved them all, really, I did! Really, I did. But what point is there in this. I will never see any of them again. I have to let go…</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And the invisible hand shattered the remains of Yeno’s heart.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">But she did not lay down and wait for death. Something held her there in place, her hand firmly rested on the solid, ash covered oak. She closed her eyes determinedly and held them in the hope of some kind of great emotional wave that would carry her to the end. She welded them shut with all the force she could and the seconds ticked onwards. All she wanted was to lay there, wait for them to come, or for starvation and thirst to take her. But the seconds ticked onwards, and her mind, so intent on trying to break her body down, let the smallest of cracks open. Through those cracks something new began to emerge. It clawed and scraped through the overbearing wall of death that had been built within the confines of Yeno’s mind. This thing, that was not her, seemed to grow through those cracks, like a weed, becoming part of the walls. Yeno opened her eyes more sharply than she intended and turned her head to gaze upon the the ruined hallway.</p>
