		<p>What does it matter? The telling of it, I mean. Disjointed from all context, what does a story mean to those that have outlived it? It looms so large, the calamity. Such an event looms so large, and the characters take centre stage in every single mind. It’s not reasonable to think that every single thing that matters is a grain of sand sitting on a beach, that waves of questions wash away. After all, we are all individuals, hunkered down in our little hovels. All those inquiring thoughts, like,”But where did the body alteration action come from?”, or “where were Yeno’s thoughts of all her friends in those first moments?” These questions originate from a world so removed from yours. The vast gulf in time might be seen as the pertinent barrier between you two. This is not so. Indeed, you could be standing in the room opposite from her and have the same disjointed perspective. You see, the most difficult thing about history is that it happens outside the little world of your experiencer. So they can call it an ‘experiencer’ all they want, but everything you sense in the tube is a reflection, a world of people you could only imagine.</p>

		<p>It doesn’t really matter what kind of person is reflected either. Everyone that finds themselves encased in walls has, by the very nature of those walls, found themselves in a world of imagination. Why else would you choose to sit in a cocoon of brick or stone or Balk? We have little pretend worlds, and then, when we walk out the door, the psychosis in our heads has to be met with the reality of the swirling maelstrom of forces outside our control. And we lose ourselves, immediately, we lose ourselves because who could hope to retain that dreamworld in the face of such chaos.</p>

		<p>This is the thing. This is the difference between a reflection and the real thing. It is an appreciation of this dichotomy that allows you to truly appreciate the beauty of experienced history. Moments open up in experience. That is it. Evidence is not some grand idea, it is all we have. Fear is as much a saviour as courage in that it comes to us as evidence of what is. I walk down a cold, dark Providence alley and I look into the eyes of a Karite, a person just like me, and she looks at my wrinkles and decides it would be fun to experience that explosion of violence so in fashion now, and  what would an old man like me pretend to do? What defence would these old bones give? What would I matter in the end anyway? For the art of it, the sense that the reflection has some kind of small resemblance to the experience that a completely different perspective has across that vast gulf of time, I think the risk is worth it.</p>

		<p>And maybe the Karites are right. I’m going to die anyway, so why not say it. I look at our civilisation and I ask you, why the massive jump in technological advancement in computational data and communication over the last fifty years? It’s not like there aren’t other fields that have the capacity for such advancement. But no other field of research so puts us so close to realising the dream of an existence of complete fulfilment. I would say, as many of my contemporaries would, that such a goal would mean the complete death of the species. For, if your fulfilment is greater than your urge to eat, or drink or breathe, well…</p>
		
		<p>But maybe the Karites are right. No one will know until it happens.</p>

		<p>You might say ‘Just stick to the official nerve, you old fool’. More people say that to me now than before, when I was younger, and this process was much more dangerous. So what is the necessity for an old man to meet a Karite in person to grasp a slither of information, to expose myself to such danger? Well, then, who are you to assume this old man is a cliche from that generation, those ones that seemed to have such bravado, such meaningful experiences. Perhaps you’re right, that I was, to my mind, part of that generation with more to prove, more to say.</p> 

		<p>But then, I digress. I apologise dear experincer. Let’s just say, for now, that it suffices that old memories are gathered. But it should be noted that, such a Karite, that is willing to walk outside her door and confront the reality of breaking such a complete code, such that it means so much to those that take the oath, shows an honesty of intent not gained by any simple promise. It certainly sufficed for me in my search. Her identity shall remain anonymous, of course. But I wish I could name her, just to state, for history’s sake, that it is possible for a Karite to feel outside of their network, and it is possible for a Providencial man to feel for her. On her story, I shall say no more.</p>

		<p>Zdravi comes up again in the window, the complex dance revolves. A woman dissapears in the mist and memory logs that have been guarded for a very long time are now sitting on my desk. So many souls at the time of the calamity, from one moment, perfectly content in a world, suddenly shattered into some kind of action. Most of us are so disorientated in such simple transitions. I ask for such seclusion of thought for a moment from you. The terror is obvious, in those moments. I ask you to imagine, instead, the vast gulf of experience within Yeno and within every soul experiencing the Calamity. Antibodies, the organisms that people had designed to implicitly to be their protectors, their helpers, tearing everything apart. Their entire world, everything they know, the comfort that was implicit…</p>
		
		<p>I ask you to try because I know you will fail, like I fail, and like they mostly failed. How could a people that have known an entire life in constant proximity to everything even conceive of a sudden gulf of existence where their certainty once stood? For most of them, they could not even conceive of a world where this could take place.</p>
