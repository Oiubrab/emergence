			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno opened her eyes</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">The open blue sky above her flooded in, as it was framed again by the overwhelming greys, blacks and greens coursing through the remains of the ceiling. Yeno didn’t want to lift her head. She didn’t want believe that she had somehow lived through that loud sharp sound of concrete cracking. She had felt the weight come across her and still she felt. She kept her eyes up and hoped again, perhaps for some lagging end.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Time began to pass, but without the ticking of the clock there was no way to tell how much of it was passing.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">It was the lack of pain that stuck out, so obviously. Yeno pulled her head out of the little crevice it was sitting in. The desolate look in her eyes began to scrunch as she pulled herself up slightly to see. The concrete block had come, mostly, over her chest and stomach. She was slightly recessed into the rubble, but the concrete block weighed half a ton. Yeno knew that. She had somehow pulled the clock around so that it had landed on her chest instead of her head.</p>
		
			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">But still, it’s the old concrete clock. It should have…</p>
		
			<p class="text_story_grey">She looked down on her body, and she was sure that her mind was finally warped beyond all hope. For none of what she saw look familiar. Or, rather, it looked like the most grotesque version of her she could imagine. Everything seemed longer, everything seemed larger. Everything to bulge outward rather than follow her slim lines. As Yeno sat up, she looked down and saw something that looked hideous in her eyes. Yeno lay back down into the rubble and closed her eyes.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">This is the last dream, the thing before the end. I am a twisted, monstrous and ugly thing. It doesn’t matter, though. None of it matters. Surely the end will come soon.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And then she heard it. A slow rumble, soft, as it had been in constancy throughout her life. There was a gentleness to the sound and, to Yeno, it was as if her whole life was being extruded through a Balk press. The sound struck her, it’s lilting, mixed with the slight crack of concrete against concrete as the sound reverberated through what was left of the hall.</p>
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">And some feeling inside Yeno crawled up from within. The origin of feeling came from the core of herself, but it’s volume was  alien. Indeed, each of us has a vivid interwoven tapestry within. A complex web of emotional motivation and endpoint that together makes the delicate artwork that is our inner life. Each string is unique, and is linked to something behind it, in front of it and around it that is just as important to the whole. Within Yeno, so much of the tapestry had been torn that these links, rather than being carefully interwoven, were now haphazard tangled and so many led to a raw nerve that fluttered in the wind of chaos. But the musical tones that drifted through the shattered hallway caught on a string that led everywhere within Yeno’s self. It’s legacy, tangled with it’s recent past, should have ripped Yeno’s tapestry to shreds.</p>			
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">But there was another line that wrapped within her. It was something she had only just seen within. It did not flutter in the wind. It tugged violently, again and again. And everything Yeno could think to do to tear that string apart only seemed to tighten it round her. It was this string that she was terrified of, and it pulled her up out of the crevice she was laying in.</p>
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno stood up, carefully. Blood rushing around drove a slight lightheaded feeling that subsided quicker than it felt it should. It had almost been automatic, the action. She looked down at the open archway, into the old eatery. As she began to tentatively step towards the arch, she could hear the old sounds reverberating louder from the eatery entrance, scratching at her as the stark monochrome grey of fallen concrete mixed in with the rotting food.</p>			
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno pulled herself round the archway and looked about her for some kind of familiarity. Perhaps something that would remind her of herself and Julia dancing in the eatery, when the minder would tell them to eat their dinner before it got cold. Everything Yeno saw was unrecognisable. And that string, that feeling within her was pulling her towards the sound.</p>				
			
			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">But if I see it, there won’t be anything left of me. I’ll break down beyond breaking. Maybe that’s good because that will be the end.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">But it sounded like she would not have to wait long for the meeting. She could hear the sound approaching her from the hallway back in the kitchen, or what she remembered to be the kitchen. She could still see old utensils sticking out in the steady state maelstrom. And she could feel that string within her tugging her further on towards the kitchen.</p>	
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">And as she picked her foot around a large boulder and across the threshold, it began to slither out from round the corner of the hallway in front of her. The necessity, never needed before, to lean down to get through the threshold, was forgotten under the weight of the churning antithesis within her.</p>				

			<p class="text_story_grey">The gelatinous form morphed around the bend. Bulges became arms and then not arms. Colours erupted out of it’s translucent skin, then dissipated again. It moved, at moments without locomotion, by a natural adhesive, and sometimes by a great pulling motion. Yeno did not break down beyond breaking. Each axis of the creature folded into Yeno’s familiarity and, at once, as it pulled itself into the room and straight towards Yeno, the string within her wrenched her out of her torpor.</p>		

			<p class="text_story_grey">She lunged out to her left and grabbed a sharp metallic cleaver that, in her hand, became a small knife. Then, as she came up, with a large turn, she swung the blade towards an outstretched limb. The speed with which she moved surprised Yeno, but not the snaking arm, as it whipped and wrapped around Yeno’s arm, pulling tight.</p>		

			<p class="text_story_grey">The string was no longer visible within Yeno, mashed up, as it were, within the tide of rage. Yeno plunged her other hand into it’s temporarily central body. She yanked back and with a sudden force the arm was ripped from the rest of the morphing shape, becoming a viscous liquid as it fell to the rubble. And now the rage took on a new form, as Yeno realised what she had done.</p>	
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">Bracing herself against the remains of an oven that still sat against the wall, she threw herself back, her right arm coming free. Landing on the jagged edges of the hard concrete, Yeno felt the pain as an abstract thing. Arms grew out from the now red shape. It grasped points all around the kitchen.</p>	

			<p class="text_story_grey">Jumping up, Yeno wrapped her massive arms around large concrete boulder she had passed in coming in to the kitchen. As the Shape used it’s arms to propel itself towards her, she threw the boulder out, catching it square. The rock came down and underneath it a large chunk of the form split away and, again, the liquid sunk down into the rubble.</p>	
			
			<p class="text_story_grey">Now Yeno jumped forward. She saw the broom wrapped in one of it’s arms. She felt the pain without as it struck the side of her chest. She kept going as every little bit of pain she had ever felt within rose to meet her and she jammed her foot into the gelatinous shape that was under her. She dove her hand into the form and plunged her fingers around the small crystal that glimmered. Yeno heard the cry, as if from some mighty beast, as she drove her hand upward, squeezing with all the rageful pain that flooded out of her.</p>	
	
			<p class="text_story_grey">And in a moment, the crystal shattered in her hand and the Antibody, one of the benign guardians that lilted in Yeno’s childhood, the one that had had such a terrible hand in the end Yeno now sought, washed away in the ruins of her self. And a scream came out from Yeno, and all the pain out with it. And as she breathed in, all the pain back in with it.</p>	

			<p class="text_story_grey">The broom handle that she used to dance around lay shattered in parts around the kitchen, now fitting in to the motif. Yeno again slumped down into the concrete, her long golden hair falling down around her face. Again a scream was unleashed out of her, but now with more the pain that sat all around her than the rage that had just drove through her.</p>
			
			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">I’ve broken it all. All of this is mine. Everything of mine is broken.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And Yeno felt to fit in with the rubble and the twisted pots and pans and that shattered symbol of innocence. The whole of it, all of it came down with the slightly blue light of Serch hanging high in the sky above. Again Yeno wanted to cry, and again there were no more tears left.</p>
