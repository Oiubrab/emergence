	<h1 style="text-align:center">Why?</h1>

	<div>

		<p class="text_essay_black"> colourThat you have found this in amongst the great weight of insecure people desperate for your attention and videos of Golgs with tree ears or, whatever hilarious trend sweeps by today is, I must say, rather unlikely. Should I say welcome? Amongst the cacophony of instantaneous human satisfaction of an emotion, you found this, so perhaps, congratulations. In any event, let’s ask the question; why?</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">Perhaps I should explain myself first. I mean, why sit down and craft this compendium of histories? There isn’t anything in these collected works that could not be found just as easily somewhere else on the nerve. I am posing this question, as much to myself as to you, of course. Perhaps I could ramble on about how amazing I am at what I do. They used to cal it a ‘job’, you know, a collection of things you did to contribute to the well being of society. Somewhat of an alien concept to anyone reading this, I imagine. Indeed, experience tells me that imagination is what’s needed when considering any idea too large to sit within an individual’s self interest. But, then, I’m getting off track, a symptom of my old age, you see.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">You know, perhaps I should just come out and say it; I have chosen to die.</p>   

		<p class="text_essay_black">I know, I know, what a gosh idea. What would I possibly stand to gain from such an act. They say that you should never reveal where you are on the nerve, and they’re probably right, but I have decided to die, so what does it matter that you know that I’m on the moon of the moon, the Providence Arm, in the second living space beyond the Frost digit terminal. Oh, that’s right, the historian isn’t supposed to talk about themselves either, so I guess I shouldn’t mention that Ithicka thinks that I, Ilius of the Providence Historians, should not sully my name and my apparently glorious reputation with some vain death experience. How self-important those who have such ample time are. Immortality and absolute power are the same thing, they both represent infinite opportunity. Of course, the irony of my imminent end being just another choice is not lost on me. But, in a sea of tranquillity, what does this fact matter either.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">What does it matter, indeed. Stit still comes up, the glorious rise of the gas giant, as it sits overhead, and I know that I have one less day before my last appointment. I don’t look forward to it, as much as I have chosen it, and it is predicable. I suppose, that all those things I said I would do, I rush through with flurry, as if I couldn’t have done them earlier. This history or, this interpretation of a small slither of history, is but a small item on a large list of documentation, final calls and gatherings of friends left to me.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">So, what of an old man, so what of an old history. In all likelihood, no one will ever read this. But maybe that’s the point. I was never any great orator for the people. After all these years, you realise no one ever was. If I believe that you exist, then you exist. Somewhere in my mind, you exist, and that is enough, because that thought motivates us to leave something behind and something later picks it up and, again, lays another brick down, and each of us builds the intellectual world around us, brick by brick, until they are solid and sturdy walls. But then, what a historical effort has been put into the destruction of that journey, the erasing of that past. From the Origin, when some conglomerate human population walked out of that drift, deleted all their logs and never again mentioned or gave any evidence of where they came from as they began building a new world on that rock peeking over the horizon before me. What they destroyed may have seemed worthless, or of less worth than the keeping of it. They didn’t offer an explanation, or make up some fantasy for generations to believe. I wonder, in my old age, seeing the distance behind now more so than in front, if the Instables knew what they were leaving for those ahead of them. Many of the philosophers through the millenia, Torus most notably, suggests that the aim of these strange people was to give us a great mystery, something that we would solve in our own time, to motivate us to grow, to search, to strive for something. What the great Torus fails to mention is, the many acts of historical vandalism undertaken because of the precedent set by our most primeval ancestors. If one thinks of the obelisk reductions, that most sanitary term for the destruction of so much of our history over the first two hundred years of the Zdravi DRI.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">But, again, why? What is the point of this history. In particular, this history. Why should an old man  sit down and write about a woman long since dead? What is it about Yeno’s story, and the story of those around her, that, in particular, merits the now precious time that I am looking to spend?</p> 

		<p class="text_essay_black">It seems that most people, as much as they can be called people these days, find some auspicious way to talk about themselves at such a time. People of an earlier time were not so encumbered with vanity. Either way, here we have a first use for the study of history, of things that came before us. For, in the multitude of statistical probabilities, there is some rate of people that are more interesting than you, per time, that accumulates upon the reality of your consciousness. If you only go in for a small bite, you may be injured by such a statement, but if you are willing to continue the journey, you may realise how useful humility is worth. Well, perhaps, you might say, if you are able to really grasp the concept of death, that an old man is indulging in some sophistry, and that humility is an outdated concept anyway, what of all this.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">And to that I say, maybe you’re right. None of the greatest heroes of our time or, indeed, any time, seemed to have a diminished view of themselves. They are all perfect to us. A hero’s light shines so brightly upon our eyes that the contrast inherent in these tumultuous individuals is drowned out by the enormity their actions. So we can only see who they really are by looking at them in focus, with the right lens. Ultimately, in anything we choose to expose ourselves to, whether it is the immersion into, or the outward observation of, we are all looking for the key that unlocks all our unfinished desires, be they grand, mundane or desperate. It is most fulfilling, therefore, to see a complete fulfilment of such an emotion, a ‘completion of the endpoints’, as the popular phrase goes. Indeed, it is terrifying to think that, actually, someone can be so broken by such immediate events that they can set fire to the middle. Actually, they can set fire to everything. And therein lies the question; what worth is the person that want’s to die? What fulfilment can I get in understanding such an act.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">After the Instables were all gone and the first generation had to take care of themselves, they started walking from Stability, along the spine of Zdravi. They didn’t know what to expect. They had been kept in their shelters and taught only what they needed to know in order to survive in the site that their Instable parents had settled them in. But they were curious, some more than others. It was a long and difficult journey. I don’t know how much you know of early Zdravi history, dear experincer. I can tell you that this is something we all know the beats of. Rather than give the full version, I should just remind you that the thousands journeyed along the spine, reached the craggy end and were, for the most part, washed away by the great tide that my dear providence sweeps across our dear first home. Every Zdravi knows the story to some degree. Indeed, even my daughter could recount the salient points up to this part. What most people seem to forget, or willfully ignore, is that Stability, as much as it was a culturally significant site in those early years, was not the place of the greatest activity and growth. As is known, not all the explorers were washed away. Death was not the end of the explorers of the spine, although the burden, especially on the women, of that early settlement, I am always pained to bear. I am not a woman, but one does not have to have the parts to feel the incredible physical and mental weight of construction of an entire population from thirty individuals. The Recreation experincers I have designed hopefully show that.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">So, hopefully it’s obvious at this point. I have spent my life in the company of others, designing these lessons, encapsulated in experiencers. Most of them don’t seem subtle. In some ways, this last of my experinces won’t be out of form. The nice thing about living on Providence is, if no one gets it, most of them aren’t physically here to knock on my door and tell me as such.</p>

		<p class="text_essay_black">The story of Yeno isn’t a story about death or suffering. I feel like I should just get that out of the way right now. No one could ever expect someone so tortured to demand anything out of life. What I would say, as much as people know, is that , and forgive the cynicsm of an old man here, that people who have never suffered for their happiness can’t begin to understand what it is like, to be in the position to have lost everything. But, that’s the point, you see. As I said before, all the great heroes seem self-assured to us because they are meant to represent an ideal. Well, Yeno doesn’t represent any ideal. She was a real person, a woman shattered, and the more you look into those heroes of your past, the more you see the resemblance to her. This is not to say that her position was in any way desirable. That should be implicit. I don’t suggest you recreate her tumult in any real sense just to gain some greater understanding, mostly because you will fail, because it was not contrived for her.</p> 

		<p class="text_essay_black">I realise I still haven’t answered that question, why? Perhaps I’m hoping that in the course of retelling this old story in a slightly new way, I might come to some understanding of this myself. So I can’t tell you right now. All I can say is that I know this is the last history I wanted to leave and I hope that you gain as much from it as I have.</p>
