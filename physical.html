			<p class="text_story_grey">It is the case, when a person suffers, no matter the weight of that suffering, that an overarching reality will bring an ajar door. A person can be driven, constantly around, in a circle of terrible thought, again and again, driving themselves into the perception of the world as a different thing from reality. Once they are in this world, the terminal nature of each detail they experience can be exaggerated to any length they desire to meet the mirror of this reality. It drags them further towards a single idea, a single sense, that they are predetermined to get to. There is no grandiose break from this spiral, no brilliant course of ideas to stop the course of every thought. But sometimes a mundane thing, something obvious, visceral and perfunctory can grate the sense for a brief moment. For those of us that think digitally, a zeroing out of a memory block, cascading through veins of logic.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">It was in this vein that Yeno could feel her stomach rumble, unlike anything she was used to. The mundanety of the feeling, the simple need to stuff a large amount of food into her mouth, it ruffled the tight interwoven strings within her. Slumped into the rubble, Yeno let the smell of rotting meat drift into her, trying to kill the rising hunger. But as the moments began to compound on one another, the practicality of the moment began to give way. There were no tears coming anyway.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">I can die once I’ve eaten</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno stood up. Slowly she picked her way to the one fridge that still hummed gently. The fact that the refrigeration devices worked on a charged battery system meant that as she found her way to the fridge, now down underneath her, the reveal of the contents brought a strong smell of fresh fruits and cured meats. Yeno felt the draw of hunger and gave way to it. The red fractal patterns inlaid in the fridge interior became more and more obvious as Yeno grabbed Oranges and pears and Jerky and munched away. The thought line, for a moment, centred on something so simply important as to what was next into her mouth. And each bite sent juices dribbling and chunks flying and Yeno couldn’t help but allow simple contentment to scratch at the horror.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">That was the sense, as she let the messiness of the act filter in through her.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And when she had grabbed everything left in the receptacle, she turned around to sit on the bench beside her and eat more deliberately. She sat down, looked up, and the thing she saw struck her.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">In the darkened recess of the kitchen, Illuminated in the light of the open refrigeration receptacle, the surviving mirror on the far wall explained in refrain what Yeno had seen only in emergence. The base statistics flashed up on the side of the mirror. Peripheral numbers, two point one lengths, several Etch mass. But the numbers were peripheral, bending away from the sheer weight of the figure staring back at Yeno.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">This can’t be me. It must be someone else, with my face and my eyes and my breasts. It is some monster, that’s stolen the most obvious physical parts of me and made some beast. This can’t be me, it can’t!</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno felt the whip, the immediate terror that courses round someone when something central to who they are is ruptured. It was the immediacy of the image, the unreality of it. And now the specifics were there, obvious. It was still female, the thing that looked back at her. It did still have the parts of her. But the awesome weight of muscle and sinew reflected in the mirror buried any sense of femininity. It was everywhere and it took the entire mirror and it was an entire form that seemed to be designed as much to run and to move as to rend and tear. The look, her look, her body, reflected that long thread that was bundled up within her.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">What Yeno saw was the opposite of everything she had been. What she saw confirmed the literal monstrosity that had avalanched into the figurative perception of herself. And now she stood back, pressing against the cold concrete behind her. The oozing Antibody continued to dribble down into the rubble below her, in part soaking into the shattered wooden remains of her childhood spread around her. The literal nature of the vision forced her to turn away.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">So finally I can die. This thing that stares back at me is too monstrous to live. It’s life is not worth anything. I am not worth anything. I was thrown away. But why can I not just take one of these sharp blades and end this!</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno picked up a broken jagged steel pot and held it to her breast, staring at the image in the mirror. She rounded out the face of it. Her face. And her arm relaxed, and something gave way to nothing. And the image of the thing staring at her finally began to cry. The blunt steel edge pierced the skin under her left breast.</p> 

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">All the beauty is dead. It’s all dead. Just push. Just push. Just push. Just, this isn’t happening. Why is this not happening? It’s all around, the splinters. The splinters of me and Julia dancing through the eatery. Stupid laughter that went through here. Oh my, what happened to us. What happened to you. And those moves. Andrei rolling his eyes. Andrei. I should have, I should tell you what I felt. I’m so sorry for not telling you how I felt. For not saying it more obviously. Who cares about the games now, fuck! Why can I not just do it.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno threw the blade to the ground, trying to look anywhere but the mirror on the wall in front of her. Dark fractal lines could be seen trailing around the walls, eminent of the style in which they were built. The lines led to a place within Yeno that she would have once called home. They shone out of the light of the fridge receptacle and a single moment of memory was gone.</p> 

			<p class="text_story_grey">And the terrible glint of the crystal remains, scattered and lodged throughout the shattered room, sparkled at her. Yeno leaned down and picked up a crystal shard. It seemed so small in her palm. She felt clumsy holding it in hands she was not used to articulating. But the shine was unmistakable, the beauty of it. It was to Yeno, as it was to everyone in the city of Justice and to everyone in an Arm, a symbol of safety, of proper judgement. The Antibodies could be frustrating, a little difficult during the day sometimes. But they were always fair and they always kept everyone safe from eachother and from themselves.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">And now the shattered remains of that symbol lay in Yeno’s large palm. Yeno breathed in. It was unreal. Everything about this moment to Yeno was outside her ability to comprehend, but the broken shard that sat on top of the palm was real. She could feel it rolling around. She could see the whole in her mind as it shattered. It was betrayal. The betrayal of a lifetime of implicit trust lay broken in her hand and, for the first time since she crawled out of that room, Yeno’s mind began to crawl outside the immediacy of her self.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">They’re all linked up to the nerve. And someone would have come by now. However long it has been, someone should have come. Why am I still alone? This can’t have been it?</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno dropped the crystal shard, as shards of her memory in the room struck her again.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey_italic">If I can’t kill myself now, then I have to get out of here. I can’t stay here, I can’t. I have to find someone.</p>

			<p class="text_story_grey">Yeno, avoiding the mirror, began to pick her way amongst the rubble. Each hand, each foot, placed itself on the child within her. Each memory she closed off as she reached the main hallway, as it turned to the left.</p> 

			<p class="text_story_grey">And the blue tinge peeled into Yeno’s view. It grew out of the blown out doorway as she fumbled her way further out to the light.</p>
